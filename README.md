# SE-Assignment-5
Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.
   ---
   ### Steps required to install VS-code on windows
    #### 1. Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.
    #### 2. Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). 3. 3. This will only take a minute.
#### By default, VS Code is installed under C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code.
## Alternatively

### Windows Subsystem for Linux
Windows is a popular operating system and it can be a great cross-platform development environment. This section describes cross-platform features such as the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the new Windows Terminal.

### Recent Windows build
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you are on a recent Windows 11 build. Check Settings > Windows Update to see if you are up-to-date.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows as a developer machine
&nbsp;&nbsp;With WSL, you can install and run Linux distributions on Windows. This enables you to develop and test your source code on Linux while still working locally on your Windows machine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;When coupled with the WSL extension, you get full VS Code editing and debugging support while running in the context of WSL.

2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
   ### 1. Basic Settings Configuration
### a. User Interface and Appearance
#### Theme: Choose a theme that is comfortable for your eyes.
Dark Theme: "One Dark Pro" or "Dracula"
Light Theme: "Atom One Light" or "Quiet Light"
Icon Theme: "Material Icon Theme" for better visual file distinctions.
b. Editor Settings
Font Family: Set to a clear, legible monospace font like "Fira Code" or "Cascadia Code".
Font Size: Adjust to your preference, typically between 12-14px.

Word Wrap: Enable word wrap to prevent horizontal scrolling.

Auto Save: Set to automatically save files after a delay.

#### 2. Extensions to Install
### a. General Enhancements
Settings Sync: Sync your settings, snippets, themes, and extensions across multiple devices.

Prettier - Code Formatter: Ensure consistent code formatting.


ESLint: Integrate ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript projects for linting.

b. Language-Specific Extensions
Python: "Python" by Microsoft for Python development.
JavaScript/TypeScript: "ESLint" and "Prettier".
HTML/CSS: "HTML CSS Support" for better autocompletion and linting.
C/C++: "C/C++" by Microsoft for debugging and IntelliSense.
### 3. Debugging Configuration
#### a. Common Debugging Tools

#### Live Server: Launch a development local server with live reload feature.
### 4. Source 
### Control Integration
#### a. Git Integration
#### GitLens: Enhance Git capabilities within VS Code, making it easier to visualize code authorship and history.
#### Git Graph: Provides a graph to visualize the repository's commit history.

### 5. Keybindings
#### Customize keybindings to enhance productivity. For example, set up shortcuts for common tasks like duplicating lines, opening the integrated terminal, or running code snippets.


3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

   #### 1._Activity Bar_ - Located on the far left-hand side. Lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled. You can change the position of the Activity Bar.

   #### 2._Side Bar_ -  Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.

   #### 3._Editor Group_ - When you split an editor (using the Split Editor or Open to the Side commands), a new editor region (edit group) is created which can hold a group of items. You can open as many editor groups as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.

   #### 4. _Status Bar._ -  Information about the opened project and the files you edit.

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?

8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
